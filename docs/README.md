# BitVault
**A Modular EVM-Compatible Layer 2 Framework for Native RWA Public Chains**

## Release Update: BitVault v1.0.0

The BitVault Labs engineering team announces the release of **BitVault v1.0.0**, representing the first stable milestone of the BitVault protocol.

This release consolidates extensive community feedback and internal research, introducing architectural refinements, improved execution performance, and enhanced modularity.

Detailed changes are documented in the accompanying release notes.

---

## 1. Overview

**BitVault** is a modular and extensible framework for constructing **Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain networks**, with a primary focus on **native Real World Asset (RWA) issuance, settlement, and lifecycle management**.

BitVault is designed as an **L2-native RWA public chain**, fully compatible with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, enabling seamless deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts and tooling.

The system architecture references and integrates concepts from:

- **Polkadot’s multi-slot and shared-security architecture**, enabling flexible execution capacity allocation
- **ZK-Rollup–based main-chain and multi-sidechain architectures**, enabling parallel execution and verifiable state compression

By combining these architectural principles, BitVault aims to achieve **high throughput, low latency, and deterministic finality**, while preserving strong security guarantees and decentralization properties.

## 2. Architectural Design

### 2.1 Layered System Model

BitVault follows a layered architecture composed of three primary components:

1. **Main Chain (Settlement Layer)**
    - Responsible for finality, global state commitments, and validator coordination
    - Maintains cryptographic commitments of sidechain state transitions
    - Anchors governance and protocol-level security

2. **Execution Sidechains (Scalability Layer)**
    - Multiple parallel EVM-compatible execution environments
    - Each sidechain processes transactions independently
    - State roots are periodically aggregated and committed to the main chain

3. **Proof and Data Availability Layer**
    - Zero-knowledge validity proofs ensure correctness of execution
    - Compressed state commitments reduce on-chain data requirements
    - Enables trust-minimized verification without transaction re-execution

This layered design allows BitVault to scale horizontally while preserving composability across the ecosystem.

---

### 2.2 Polkadot-Inspired Multi-Slot Execution Model

BitVault adopts a **multi-slot execution model**, conceptually aligned with Polkadot’s parachain framework:

- Execution capacity is partitioned into logical slots
- Slots are dynamically allocated to execution sidechains
- Validators may participate across multiple slots to improve utilization

This approach enables:

- Elastic scaling under variable transaction load
- Execution environment isolation
- Reduced resource contention and predictable performance

---

### 2.3 ZK-Rollup–Inspired State Aggregation

State transitions generated by execution sidechains are:

- Batched off-chain
- Proven using zero-knowledge validity proofs
- Committed to the main chain as succinct cryptographic commitments

This design provides:

- Verifiable correctness without on-chain re-execution
- Reduced settlement costs
- Significantly improved TPS compared to monolithic execution models

---

## 3. EVM Compatibility

BitVault provides full **EVM equivalence**, including support for:

- Solidity and Vyper smart contracts
- Ethereum JSON-RPC interfaces
- Standard developer tooling (Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle)

This ensures minimal migration friction for existing Ethereum-based applications, including DeFi protocols, asset tokenization platforms, and RWA compliance frameworks.

---

## 4. RWA-Oriented Design Considerations

BitVault is architected with **RWA-specific requirements** in mind:

- Deterministic transaction ordering for asset settlement
- Modular compliance and identity integration hooks
- Support for permissioned execution environments
- Configurable finality and settlement guarantees

These design choices enable BitVault to serve as a foundational infrastructure layer for tokenized securities, commodities, real estate representations, and other regulated asset classes.

## 5. Development Status and Security

> **Disclaimer**  
> BitVault is under active development.  
> Architectural changes may occur as research progresses and audit feedback is incorporated.

- The codebase undergoes continuous internal review
- External security audits are ongoing or planned
- Production usage should be preceded by independent risk assessment

---

## 6. Documentation

Comprehensive technical documentation is under active development and will include:

- Protocol and consensus specifications
- Validator and slot allocation mechanisms
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification flows
- Sidechain lifecycle and upgrade processes
- RWA integration and compliance guidelines
